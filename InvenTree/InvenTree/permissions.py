    Role mixin for API endpoints, allowing us to specify the user "role"
    which is required for certain operations.

    Each endpoint can have one or more of the following actions:
    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - PATCH
    - DELETE

    Specify the required "role" using the role_required attribute.

    e.g.

    role_required = "part"

    The RoleMixin class will then determine if the user has the required permission
    to perform the specified action.

    For example, a DELETE action will be rejected unless the user has the "part.remove" permission
